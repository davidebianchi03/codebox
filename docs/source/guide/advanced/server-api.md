# Server APIs

```{warning}
   Since codebox is still in beta APIs can change
```

A complete collection of all available APIs is provided here. These APIs are the same ones used by the Codebox web app and CLI.

The documentation about the APIs is available {{ '[here]({}/api/codebox-server/)'.format(server_base_url) }}.
