# GIT
Codebox generates an SSH key pair for each user. The private key is automatically injected into your containers, while the public key is available in your profile details. You can add the public key to your Git server to enable authentication. This key pair is also used to authenticate requests for retrieving workspace configurations from Git repositories.
